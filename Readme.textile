h1. Javascript Screens

Javascript Screens is a simple Screen system for Javascript.

It uses:

* John Resig's "Simple Javascript Inheritance":http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
* "Sammy.js":http://sammyjs.org/ to manage routes
* "Knockout.js":http://knockoutjs.com/ to bind data using MVVM
* "Knockout.unobstrusive.js":https://github.com/bsatrom/Knockout.Unobtrusive to clean HTML of logic
* "Lab.js":http://labjs.com/ to load scripts in an ordered way
* "HTML5 Boilerplate":http://html5boilerplate.com/ as a base.

h2. Usage

You can create new screens extending from class Screen. There are 2 example screens, Index.js and Content.js

You must register new screens using
APP.register('key', new ScreenName());

And you start sammy.js by defining 
APP.init(id) where id is the id of the element Sammy will be working on.

You can add css class ".link" to automatically route to that id. For instance

%button#about.link=About will route to #/about

It uses sammy.haml.js plugin for Sammy, which works with haml.js to render .haml files client-side, but you can disable it and use regular html files, or use another template engine like mustache, or whichever you like most.
